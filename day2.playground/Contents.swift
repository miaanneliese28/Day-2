//Kode With Klossy Camp - Day 2 Warm-up
//defining what my favorite university is and making a statement to go along with it
var favUniversity = "Stanford"
var statement1 = "is a good school"
//making a sentence with interpolation using the variables I just defined
print("\(favUniversity) \(statement1)")
//defining what my favorite city is with a constant and making a statement to go along with it
let favCity = "Palo Alto, California"
var statement2 = "is a cool place"
//making a sentence with interpolation using the constant and variable I just defined
print("\(favCity) \(statement2)")
//another way to print the statements about the variables is to write 'print("I love \(favUniversity)")' instead of making a variable that had the statement
var string1 = "I love"
var string2 = "Stanford University"
